# The First Chrome Extension for Shortmail
See your Shortmail unread count in Chrome. Enter your Shortmail email and password in the options page, and the extension will check your account every 60 seconds, displaying the unread count as a badge. Uses the new [Shortmail API](http://api.shortmail.com/api/index.html).

### Installation
